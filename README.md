# Entro.py
The 40th anniversary of Julian Gollop's seminal Chaos: Battle of Wizards is fast approaching.  This is a humble hobbyist Python tribute.

## Keys
Arena movement, casting and ending turn mimic the original:
```
QWE            
A D  : cursor movement 
ZXC

S: Select 
K: Cancel casting or movement
0: End turn
```

Additionally the number keys 2-8 will toggle frame highlights for the corresponding wizard
and the TAB key will toggle colour-coded bases.
