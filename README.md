The 40th anniversary of Julian Gollop's seminal Chaos: Battle of Wizards is fast approaching.  
This is a humble hobbyist Python tribute.

### Thanks and notes:
If you're looking for the definitive remake of Chaos, look no further than Richard Quirk's outstanding android version (available <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=chaos.app">here</a> at the Google Play Store</a>).  I'm very grateful for this version keeping Chaos alive and well, not to mention widely available.

Thanks also to this Chaos disassembly project that I stumbled across at: https://zxnet.co.uk/spectrum/chaos/
